# Game Publishing Decision Support System

## Overview  
This project was developed as part of the **Decision Support Systems (YBS 3015)** course at Dokuz Eyl√ºl University.  
The system is designed to help **game publishing companies** evaluate and select high-potential games by analyzing marketing data, in-game metrics, and user behavior.  

With the rapid growth of the gaming industry and the ease of access to game development tools, publishers receive thousands of submissions every year. Since resources are limited, selecting the most promising titles is essential. This Decision Support System (DSS) provides data-driven insights to assist publishers in making strategic choices.  

The system processes advertising metrics (CPI, CVR, CTR), in-game performance indicators (APPU, retention, playtime), and demographic data (age and gender distribution). Results are visualized through charts, cohort analysis tables, and summary indicators to highlight the overall publishing potential of each game.
